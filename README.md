# Hi, I'm Shaun! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst with an interest for problem-solving and storytelling through data. With a strong foundation in Power BI, Power Automate, and PowerShell, I've created solutions for data-driven decision-making and process automation. I have hands-on experience in developing business intelligence reports and handling sensitive data with precision.

## Recent Projects:

### Labratory Work Requesting System 
Developed an efficient system for handling departmental requests using Microsoft Forms, Power Automate, and PowerShell to streamline workflows.

### Automated Reporting Routines
Created several time-saving Python scripts using libraries like Pandas and Openpyxl to generate scheduled reports in a fraction of the time.

### Power BI Reports and Dashboard for Cancer Reporting
Gathered and utilised data from healthcare systems to author Power BI material for NHS clinicians and managers, allowing them to improve on Cancer Pathway KPIs and turnaround times.

I completed a Data Analyst course with Cambridge Spark, where I honed my skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization, and I'm actively seeking opportunities in data analysis or Power BI development.
